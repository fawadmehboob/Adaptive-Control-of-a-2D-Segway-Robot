# Adaptive-Control-of-a-2D-Segway-Robot

This repository defines a systematic approach of solving a control problem of a 2D Segway robot using Lyapunov-based Adaptive Control. The idea of adaptive control is to control a system under uncertain conditions where some parameter $\theta$ of the system is unknown. In the case of a Segway robot this could be thought of as the friction coefficient at the pivot joint between the wheels and link. The dynamics of this system are given as:

$$ M \ddot{x} + C \ddot{\phi} cos(\phi) - C \dot{\phi}^2 sin(\phi) = \frac{T}{R}$$
$$ I \ddot{\phi} + C \ddot{x} cos(\phi) + \theta \dot{\phi} - C g sin(\phi) = - T$$

Unknown Coefficient of friciton: $\theta$


Here $M$, $I$, and $C$ are constant system parameters defined as:
$M = m_1 + m_2 +\frac{I_2}{R^2}$, $I = I_1 + m_1 (\frac{l}{2})^2$, and $C = m_1 \frac{l}{2}$; $m_1$, and $m_2$ are the masses of the wheel and the link respectively, $l$ is the link length, $g$ is gravitational constant, $R$ is the wheel radius, $I_2$ is the link inertia, $T$ is the torque input to the wheel, and $\theta$ is the unknown parameter that we shall handle using the adaptive control. A more elaborate detail of the dynamics can be found in the markdown "SegWay Dynamics.md".


# Dynamics Linearization
Since the segway is intended to operate around an equilibrium position, it is reasonable to linearize the dynamics about the point $\phi = 0$, $\dot{\phi} \approx0$, which lead to the dynamics

$$ M \ddot{x}+C\ddot{\phi}=\frac{T}{R}$$
$$ I \ddot{\phi}+C\ddot{x}  = -T-\theta\dot{\phi}-Cg\phi$$

### State and Action Space

$$
S = [x, \dot{x}, \phi, \dot{\phi}],
$$

$$
a = \begin{bmatrix}
T \\
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

## Lyapunov Control
Now we define a variable \( e \), which we call the sliding surface. This will help us define all the states in a single variable and facilitate the implementation of the Lyapunov method with adaptive control.

$$
e = k_1 x + k_2 \dot{x} + k_3 \phi + k_4 \dot{\phi}
$$


Here, $k_1$, $k_2$, $k_3$, $k_4$ are tuneable parameters.

Our Goal is to drive $e$ to zero so that all the states are driven to zero.
If we define a Lyapunov function without considering the unknown parameter $\theta$, such as a simpler form:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} e^2
$$

we would face challenges in achieving a strictly negative Lyapunov derivative due to the presence of the unknown friction coefficient $\theta$. The derivative of this simpler Lyapunov function is:

$$
\dot{L} = e \dot{e}
$$

Substituting the expression for $\dot{e}$:

$$
\dot{e} = k_1 \dot{x} + k_3 \dot{\phi} + a T + b \phi + c \theta \dot{\phi}
$$

we get:

$$
\dot{L} = e \left( k_1 \dot{x} + k_3 \dot{\phi} + a T + b \phi + c \theta \dot{\phi} \right)
$$

To make $\dot{L} \leq 0$, we might attempt to choose the control torque $T$ to cancel the known terms and make $\dot{L}$ negative, for example:

$$
v T = -p e - k_1 \dot{x} - k_3 \dot{\phi} - b \phi
$$

$$
T = \frac{-p e - k_1 \dot{x} - k_3 \dot{\phi} - b \phi}{v}
$$

Substituting this $T$ into $\dot{e}$:

$$
\dot{e} = -p e + c \theta \dot{\phi}
$$

Thus:

$$
\dot{L} = e (-p e + c \theta \dot{\phi}) = -p e^2 + e c \theta \dot{\phi}
$$

## Adaptive Lyapunov Control

The term $e c \theta \dot{\phi}$ introduces a problem: since $\theta$ is unknown, we cannot guarantee that $\dot{L}$ is strictly negative. Depending on the values of  $e$, $\dot{\phi}$, and $\theta$, the term  $e c \theta \dot{\phi}$ could be positive and potentially dominate $-p e^2$ , making  $\dot{L} > 0 $. This means the systemâ€™s stability cannot be ensured using this simple Lyapunov approach, as we lack a mechanism to handle the uncertainty in $\theta$.

In contrast, the adaptive control approach we implemented introduces an estimate $\hat{\theta}$ for the unknown $\theta$, and augments the Lyapunov function to include the estimation error:

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} e^2 + \frac{1}{2 \alpha} (\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2
$$

This allows us to define an update law for $\hat{\theta}$ that cancels the effect of the unknown $\theta$, resulting in a strictly negative Lyapunov derivative $\dot{L} = -p e^2 $, as shown later. This adaptive method effectively stabilizes both $x$ and $\phi$, driving them to zero, which would not have been possible with the simpler Lyapunov function due to the uncertainty in $\theta$.

we take the derivative of e:


$$ \dot{e} = k_1\dot{x} + k_2\ddot{x} + k_3\dot{\phi} + k_4\ddot{\phi} $$

the derivative of e can be defined in a simpler form by isolating the terms $T$, $\phi$ and $\theta\dot{\phi}$.


$$ \dot{e} = k_1\dot{x} + k_3\dot{\phi} + aT + b \phi + c \theta\dot{\phi} $$
where
$$v = \frac{1}{MI - C^2} {k_2{\frac{I}{R}+C}- k_4{\frac{C}{R}+M}}$$
$$b = \frac{Cg}{MI - C^2} {-k_2C+ k_4M}$$
$$c = \frac{1}{MI - C^2} {k_2C- k_4M}$$

###  Adaptive Lyapunov Formulation

we define a Lyapunov function:

$$L = \frac{1}{2} e^2 + \frac{1}{2} (\hat{\theta} - \theta)^2$$

The derivative of this Lyapunov function is:

$$\dot{L} = e\dot{e} +(\hat{\theta} - \theta)\dot{\hat{\theta}}$$

Now Substituting $\dot{e}$ and grouping the terms involving $\theta$ together,
here we treat $\dot{e}$ differently by relpacing $\theta$ as an error term of the estimated $\hat{\theta}$ and $\theta$:

$\dot{e} = k_1\dot{x} + k_3\dot{\phi} + aT + b \phi + c ({\theta - \dot{\hat{\theta}}})\dot{\phi}$


$$\dot{L} = e(k_1\dot{x} + k_3\dot{\phi} + aT + b \phi + c \hat{\theta}\dot{\phi}) +ec(\theta - \hat{\theta})\dot{\phi} + (\theta- \hat{\theta})\dot{\hat{\theta}}$$


Now We want the part of our lyapunov derivative that has the state $e$ and control action $T$ to be $\leq-pe$, where $\p$ is a design parameter, this will ensure that our control action keeps the lyapunov derivative strictly negative and thus ensuring a stable system.
we choose the control action T as:

$$ T = \frac{-pe + k_1\dot{x} + k_3 \dot{\phi} + b \phi + c\hat{\theta} \dot{\phi}}{a}$$

Substituting this T into $\dot{L}$ we get:

$$\dot{L} = -pe^2 +ec(\theta - \hat{\theta})\dot{\phi} + (\theta- \hat{\theta})\dot{\hat{\theta}}$$

To get rid of the unknown $\theta$ term we propose an update law for $hat{\theta}$ as:

$$ \dot{\hat{\theta}} = -ec\dot{\phi}$$

This cancels the terms incluing $\theta$ and leaves us with a Lyapunov function derivative:

$$\dot{L} = -pe^2$$

which is strictly negative and satisfies our goal of driving the states to zero.
